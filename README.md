🎯 Overview
This project implements and compares two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures for classifying human activities using smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope data. The models can recognize 6 different activities:

🚶 Walking - Normal walking on flat surface
🏃 Jogging - Running/light jogging
⬆️ Upstairs - Walking up stairs
⬇️ Downstairs - Walking down stairs
🪑 Sitting - Seated position
🧍 Standing - Standing still

Why This Project?

Practical Applications: Fitness tracking, fall detection, elderly care, context-aware computing
Architecture Comparison: Comprehensive evaluation of CNN vs Transformer for time series
Production Ready: Includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization pipelines
Educational: Well-documented code with detailed explanations
